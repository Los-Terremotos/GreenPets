# Preparing for Deployment (Best Practices):

  CI/CD Services:
  Popular services include Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and others.

1. Configuration Management:

    Utilize environment variables for configuration, allowing easy adaptation to different environments (development, staging, production).

2. Separate Environments:

    Have distinct configurations for development, testing, and production.
    Use environment-specific configuration files or environment variables.

3. Optimize Build for Production:

    Ensure your build process optimizes assets for production (minification, bundling, etc.).
    Configure TypeScript to compile to the latest ECMAScript version supported by your target browsers.

4. Set Up Server Configuration:

    Configure your server to handle the deployed application correctly.
    Consider using a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications.

5. Database Migrations:

    If applicable, include a mechanism for applying database migrations as part of the deployment process.

6. Logging and Monitoring:

    Implement logging and monitoring to catch issues early in the deployment pipeline.
    Integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or others depending on your requirements.

7. Automated Testing:

    Incorporate automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline to catch potential issues before deployment.

8. Rollback Mechanism:

    Have a rollback plan in case of deployment failures.
    Implement versioning or tagging for releases to facilitate rollbacks.
