# KP's daily logs / notes for Green Pets

## Wed Nov. 22nd

### Setting up branch & adding quality of life improvements to repo
- Project set up exists on ```dev``` branch. Used cli command ```git clone -b dev https://github.com/Los-Terremotos/GreenPets.git``` to clone ```dev``` branch
```git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>```

- Created a pull request to add pull_request_template.md. Followed directions from [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).

### Adding Frontend Dependencies
- React-router-dom: `npm install react-router-dom`
  - [Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
- Styled components: `npm install styled-components`
  - [Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation)
- @apollo/client graphql: `npm install @apollo/client graphql`
  - [Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started)
- Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`
  - [Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- React testing library: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react`
  - [Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Testing for react components that use GraphQL: [Documentation here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/)
  - **Decision** to use **Jest** because it works well with React and supports snapshot testing. It's main benefit is to showcase ability to write unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests for React components and TypeScript Code.
  - Opt against Cypress, since Cypress is more emphasized for end-to-end testing

- Install "Jest" for backend testing as well : 
  - [Testing checklist](https://dev.to/amplication/best-practices-in-testing-graphql-apis-499n)
- **Updated Node.js to version 20.10** due to "EBADENGINE" error when attempting to install jest to server folder


## Friday December 1st, 2023

### Ticket 18 - FS Testing
- Created a FS-UnitTesting branch
- Installing `react-test-renderer` for both client / server folders, for rendering snapshots
  - `npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer`
- Installing babel dependencies, for both client & server folders
  - `npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react-test-renderer`
  - `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript`
- Add "test": "jest" script to package.json file 
- Create `babel.config.js` file:
```
export const presets = [
  '@babel/preset-env',
  ['@babel/preset-react', { runtime: 'automatic' }],
  '@babel/preset-typescript', 
];
```

### Need to do next
- Create sample tests for both front end and back end


## Saturday December 2nd, 2023
- Researching proper way to setup jest with typescript, within a monorepo
  - [Docs for installing with typescript](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript)
- **Note** Need to install `ts-node` to be able to use jest to test type-checking during tests.
  - Babel does not support type-checking within react. It focuses on transforming code syntax and features
- Install additional dependencies: `npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest`
  - [Docs for ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation)
  - [Help with setting up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom#with-typescript)
- Set up file `jest.config.js` with root folder. Below is the suggested configuration using ES6 module syntax
```
export const preset = 'ts-jest';
export const testEnvironment = 'node';
export const testMatch = [
  "**/__tests__/**/*.ts?(x)",
  "**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts?(x)"
];

```
- Next, create a separate typescript config file within root folder just for tests: `tsconfig.test.json`
```
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json", // Reference your main tsconfig.json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx", // If you're using React
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "src/**/*.tsx"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}

```
- Next, create testing folders in root directory: `/client/tests/__tests__/(create test files here)`
- Here is initial test file to check content on homepage App.tsx:
```
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from '../../src/App';


test('renders App component', () => {
  render(<App />);

  // Use screen.getByText to find elements by their text content
  const titleElement = screen.getByText(/Green Pets/i);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText(/Test login here/i);
  const comingSoonElement = screen.getByText(/c o m i n g s o o n /i);

  // Assert that the elements are in the document
  expect(titleElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(comingSoonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
})
```
- Will see an error on the matcher "toBeInTheDocument" assertion. Requires package `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom`
  - [Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom)
  - [Docs for jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom/)
- Within the `jest.config.js` file, import `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';` at the top
- Then, added this: `export const setupFilesAfterEnv = ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'];`
  - This option is an array of file paths that Jest will execute after the test framework has been installed in the environment but before each test suite is executed
- Finally, added `"./jest.config.js"` into the **"include"** array within the `tsconfig.test.json` file
- .eslintrc.cjs Added "jest":true to env property.
- Changed this configuration: `export const setupFilesAfterEnv = ['@testing-library/jest-dom'];`
- Added: `"types": ["jest", "@types/testing-library__jest-dom"]` to compiler options in tsconfig.test.
- Install types for testing libraray jest-dom: `npm install --save-dev @types/testing-library__jest-dom`
- Install "ts-node": `npm install --save-dev ts-node`
- Added `"esModuleInterop": true` to both **tsconfig.json** files, within the **"compilerOptions"** configuration
- Added `/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars */` to top of App.test.tsx file
- Will commit current code and reset project, hoping will reset the eslint and fix the error. Current error when running `npm test`:
```
Kevins-MacBook-Pro:client KP824$ npm test

> client@0.0.0 test
> jest

 FAIL  tests/__tests__/App.test.tsx
  ‚óè Test suite failed to run

    tests/__tests__/App.test.tsx:2:1 - error TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read.

    2 import React from "react";
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       0 total

```

### After restart of vs code:
-Error in App.test.tsx file:
```
Cannot find name 'test'. Do you need to install type definitions for a test runner? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/jest` or `npm i --save-dev @types/mocha`.ts(2582)
```

- Updated "jsx" configration to "react-jsxdev"
- Added "tests" to the "includes" config within the tsconfig.json property
- Added the following to the `jest.config.ts` file. This configuration is an array of regex that Jest will use to determine which files should not be transformed. The regex expression `\\.css$` targets CSS files specifically 
```
transformIgnorePatterns: [
    '/node_modules/',
    '\\.css$'
  ]
```
- [Thread that gave clue to include "tests" folder within tsconfig.config "include" config](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31226)
- [Also helpful thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63904196/esmoduleinterop-flag-set-still-getting-default-import-error)
  - `"include": ["src", "tests"],`

- Tried alternative : `npm install --save-dev identity-obj-proxy`

```
moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy'
  },
```
- Next, updated testEnvironment in jest.config.ts to `testEnvironment: 'jsdom',  // Set test environment to jsdom`
- Installed **jsdom**: `npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom`
  - [Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-environment-jsdom)
- Test FINALLY PASSING! SUCCESS!!!

### Need to do next: 
- Check if same amount of installing is required for back end testing in jest. 
- Currently only have client folder working properly


## Monday December 4th
- Created new branch for ticket #7. Will create a display that will render the data from the endpoints passed through.
- Created pages folder and moved App/HomePage to folder
- Updated `main.tsx` with createRoot + router configurations to route from home page to the test display component
- Created TestDisplay component & added styling for display structure
- Install axios: `npm install axios`
- Imported Plant list and Plant details into the test display component. 



## Tuesday December 5th
- Styled display components. Had issues with getting the DataContent components to fit within the DisplayPage container. The proper fix was using "max-height" on the DisplayContainer
- Imported fetch requests for the three available endpoints for free tier plant API
- Created mock data files to render for testing up coming results page
- The Plant List endpoint will return 1 page of up to 30 plants
- Will need to select since plant ID and then send a second request to get specific plant details

- Code block from Stephanie. Required inputs from user to properly write query to the API
- Reference later when creating questionnaire page
```
export function processParams(inputNumber: number, inputString: string) {
  const numToString: { [key: number]: string } = {
    1: "none",
    2: "minimum",
    3: "average",
    4: "frequent",
  };

  const wateringParam = numToString[inputNumber];

  let indoorParam;
  if (inputString === "indoor"  inputString === "Indoor") {
    indoorParam = 1;
  } else if (inputString === "outdoor"  inputString === "Outdoor") {
    indoorParam = 0;
  }
  return {
    wateringParam,
    indoorParam,
  };
}
```

## Wednesday Dec. 6th
- Uninstall `apollo-server-core` && `apollo-server-express` since both are **deprecated**
- Followed docs here to update index.ts file:
  - [Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration)
- Current error on `getTokenFromRequest` method:
  ```Cannot find name 'getTokenFromRequest'.ts(2304)
  any```


## Saturday December 16th

- Goal today is to complete configuration of jest for the server folder
- [Documentation for testing react components](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/)

- Here is a list of topics for us to test on the backend, using Jest:
  1. **Server-Side Logic:**
    - You can write unit tests for functions and modules that handle server-side logic.
    - Jest allows you to test various scenarios and edge cases to ensure your server-side code behaves as expected.
  
  2. **API Endpoints:**
    - If your backend exposes RESTful API endpoints, you can use Jest to write integration tests to verify the correctness of these endpoints.
    - Jest provides facilities for making HTTP requests and assertions, making it suitable for testing API responses.
  
  3. **GraphQL Resolvers:**
    - For a project involving GraphQL, you can use Jest to test your GraphQL resolvers.
    - Write tests to ensure that your resolvers handle queries and mutations correctly, and that they return the expected results.
  
  4. **Database Interactions:**
    - If your backend interacts with a database, you can use Jest to write tests that involve database operations.
    - Techniques like mocking or using a test database can help isolate your tests and avoid affecting the production database.

- Installing dependencies: `npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest`
- Updated scipt "test" to "jest" within package.json
- Created `jest.config.ts` file within the root of the `server` folder
- Within `tsconfig.json` file, added "jest" to the "types" property
- Created `__tests__` folder within the root of the `server` folder
  - Create `index.test.ts` file within `__tests__` folder
- Modified the `index.ts` file so that the functions `getTokenFromRequest` and `startApolloServer` are about to be exported to test. 
- Set up first test to test the `getTokenFromRequest` function. Test is successfully passing


## Thursday Jan 4th, 2024
- Goals today:
  - Create a modal for user auth components
  - Create login / register components
  - Implement successful toggeling of either components


- Created modal with test text box
  - Will need to add state management with redux to toggel 

- Created user Auth Slice and added to the redux store
- Creating container display for login component
- Installed "react-icons" for "x" for login component
- Creating Sign up component
  - Only implementing the "x" icon to be able to toggle open and closing the modals


## Monday Jan 8th, 2024
### General approach for setting up modal and toggling for login / signup components

1. Store file:
import modal, login & signup reducers
add modal, login & signup reducers

2. Features -> modal -> modal slice:
- Instantiate two reducers (openModal & closeModal)
- export for use
- cleaned up console logs

Features -> userAuth -> loginSlice:
- Instantiate initial state of login component & two reducers (openLogin & closeLogin)
- export for use

Features -> userAuth -> signUpSlice:
- Instantiate initial state of signup component and two reducers (openSignUp & closeSignUp)
- export for use

- Initial approach for implementing toggle for modal and login/singup component, within the modalSlice:
```
const modalSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'modal',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    openModal: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.isOpen = true;
      state.activeComponent = action.payload;
    },
    closeModal: (state) => {
      state.isOpen = false;
      state.activeComponent = null;
    },
  },
});
```
- This approach above did not work. With console logs, we could see that the clicking of the buttons on `login` or `signup` buttons on the `navbar` did correctly update the state for the modal. However, the console logs within the "Login" and "Signup" components themselves, showed that their state was set to undefined. The console logs from the parent component (navbar) was showing that the state was updated. The use of useEffects within each of the child components (login/signup) also showed that the state would render "underfined". 
- The current resolution was to instantiate slices for each of the components individually, and set their initial state to a boolean value. This worked much better than asking the parent component (Modal) to read their property of `activeComponent` and render the respective component.


3. components -> Modal.tsx:
	- Create Modal component
	- styled component to blur the background so user auth components can be focused
	- z-index is set to 5 (login & signup components set to z-index 10)
	- Modal component imports Login & SignUp components:
		- Modal conditionally renders either Login or SignUp component, based on which ever button was clicked on (Buttons are located on navbar component)

  - Initial approach for Modal creation:
```
//render with conditional:
{isOpen && (
  <ModalContainer>

    <button onClick={handleCloseModal}>
      &times;
    </button>

    <TestBox>
      <h3>Hello inside Modal</h3>
    </TestBox>
    
    {activeComponent === 'login' && <Login />}
    {activeComponent === 'signup' && <SignUp />}

  </ModalContainer>
)} 
```


4. Navbar component improvements:

- Initial approach for implementing the modal and the login/signup components:
```
const handleLoginClick = () => {
  console.log(`Inside handle login click`);
  const result = dispatch(openModal('login')); // Pass the component identifier
  console.log(`Dispatch result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
  dispatch(openModal());
};

const handleSignUpClick = () => {
  console.log(`Inside handle signup click`);
  const result = dispatch(openModal('signup')); // Pass the component identifier
  console.log(`Dispatch result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
  dispatch(openModal());
};

// log to check the current state from store
  const sliceCheck = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.modalToggle);
  console.log(`sliceCheck: ${JSON.stringify(sliceCheck)}`)

// useEffect logs to check current react state and if the components were rerendering correctly when state was being updated:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Effect LOGIN ran: State: ${JSON.stringify(selectModalState)}`);
}, [selectModalState]);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Effect SIGNUP ran: State: ${JSON.stringify(selectModalState)}`);
}, [selectModalState]);
```

- Import Modal component, openLogin & openSignUp slices
- In the component logic section, create functions that use the proper reducers to toggle the preferred component
- In return statement: Conditionally renders Modal component when either "Login" or "Signup" button is clicked. One of the two reducers attached to the both buttons, will set Modal.isOpen state to `true`

5. Build Login component within components folder:
	- import closeModal, closeLogin, and openSignUp slices
	- Within component logic:
		- Create place holder for Login submit button
		- Create helper functions to help toggling of login component or switching to SignUp component

6. Build SignUp component within components folder:
	- import closeModal, closeSignUp, and openLogin slices
	- Within component logic:
		- Create place holder for SignUp submit button
		- Create helper functions to help toggling of signup component or switching to Login component


7. Cleaned up unneccessary code / console logs on homepage page



## Tuesday Jan 16th
### Created Infinite slider component
- Created styled components for slider wrapper, container, images slider, and plant image components
- Created a variable to container the keyframes css styling attributes
  - Resources for keyframes:
    - [Freecodecamp Blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-css-in-5-minutes-e0804813fc3e/)
    - [Styled components animations](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#animations) 
    - [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes)

- To copy the images component, needed to use React's `useRef` hook to properly reference and clone
  - [Official docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)
-  Leveraged `useEffect` hook to automatically clone and append the image component on itself so that it will infinitely loop through its contents:
```
useEffect(() => {
    // Logic to clone and append the content after the component mounts
    if (imagesSliderRef.current) {
      // cloning logic targets the "ImageSlider" component directly. Clones the entire component then appends it to the parent node, which is the "ImageSlider"
      const copy = imagesSliderRef.current.cloneNode(true);
      imagesSliderRef.current.parentNode?.appendChild(copy);
    }
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this effect runs once after mount
```
- Images are currently hard coded in an array. Need to decide as a group if we'll keep this or implement a different approach
