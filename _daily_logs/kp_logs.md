# KP's daily logs / notes for Green Pets

## Wed Nov. 22nd

### Setting up branch & adding quality of life improvements to repo
- Project set up exists on ```dev``` branch. Used cli command ```git clone -b dev https://github.com/Los-Terremotos/GreenPets.git``` to clone ```dev``` branch
```git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>```

- Created a pull request to add pull_request_template.md. Followed directions from [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).

### Adding Frontend Dependencies
- React-router-dom: `npm install react-router-dom`
  - [Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
- Styled components: `npm install styled-components`
  - [Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation)
- @apollo/client graphql: `npm install @apollo/client graphql`
  - [Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started)
- Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`
  - [Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- React testing library: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react`
  - [Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Testing for react components that use GraphQL: [Documentation here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/)
  - **Decision** to use **Jest** because it works well with React and supports snapshot testing. It's main benefit is to showcase ability to write unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests for React components and TypeScript Code.
  - Opt against Cypress, since Cypress is more emphasized for end-to-end testing

- Install "Jest" for backend testing as well : 
  - [Testing checklist](https://dev.to/amplication/best-practices-in-testing-graphql-apis-499n)
- **Updated Node.js to version 20.10** due to "EBADENGINE" error when attempting to install jest to server folder


## Friday December 1st, 2023

### Ticket 18 - FS Testing
- Created a FS-UnitTesting branch
- Installing `react-test-renderer` for both client / server folders, for rendering snapshots
  - `npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer`
- Installing babel dependencies, for both client & server folders
  - `npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react-test-renderer`
  - `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript`
- Add "test": "jest" script to package.json file 
- Create `babel.config.js` file:
```
export const presets = [
  '@babel/preset-env',
  ['@babel/preset-react', { runtime: 'automatic' }],
  '@babel/preset-typescript', 
];
```

### Need to do next
- Create sample tests for both front end and back end


## Saturday December 2nd, 2023
- Researching proper way to setup jest with typescript, within a monorepo
  - [Docs for installing with typescript](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript)
- **Note** Need to install `ts-node` to be able to use jest to test type-checking during tests.
  - Babel does not support type-checking within react. It focuses on transforming code syntax and features
- Install additional dependencies: `npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest`
  - [Docs for ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation)
  - [Help with setting up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom#with-typescript)
- Set up file `jest.config.js` with root folder. Below is the suggested configuration using ES6 module syntax
```
export const preset = 'ts-jest';
export const testEnvironment = 'node';
export const testMatch = [
  "**/__tests__/**/*.ts?(x)",
  "**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts?(x)"
];

```
- Next, create a separate typescript config file within root folder just for tests: `tsconfig.test.json`
```
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json", // Reference your main tsconfig.json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx", // If you're using React
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "src/**/*.tsx"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}

```
- Next, create testing folders in root directory: `/client/tests/__tests__/(create test files here)`
- Here is initial test file to check content on homepage App.tsx:
```
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from '../../src/App';


test('renders App component', () => {
  render(<App />);

  // Use screen.getByText to find elements by their text content
  const titleElement = screen.getByText(/Green Pets/i);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText(/Test login here/i);
  const comingSoonElement = screen.getByText(/c o m i n g s o o n /i);

  // Assert that the elements are in the document
  expect(titleElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(comingSoonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
})
```
- Will see an error on the matcher "toBeInTheDocument" assertion. Requires package `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom`
  - [Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom)
  - [Docs for jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom/)
- Within the `jest.config.js` file, import `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';` at the top
- Then, added this: `export const setupFilesAfterEnv = ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'];`
  - This option is an array of file paths that Jest will execute after the test framework has been installed in the environment but before each test suite is executed
- Finally, added `"./jest.config.js"` into the **"include"** array within the `tsconfig.test.json` file
- .eslintrc.cjs Added "jest":true to env property.
- Changed this configuration: `export const setupFilesAfterEnv = ['@testing-library/jest-dom'];`
- Added: `"types": ["jest", "@types/testing-library__jest-dom"]` to compiler options in tsconfig.test.
- Install types for testing libraray jest-dom: `npm install --save-dev @types/testing-library__jest-dom`
- Install "ts-node": `npm install --save-dev ts-node`
- Added `"esModuleInterop": true` to both **tsconfig.json** files, within the **"compilerOptions"** configuration
- Added `/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars */` to top of App.test.tsx file
- Will commit current code and reset project, hoping will reset the eslint and fix the error. Current error when running `npm test`:
```
Kevins-MacBook-Pro:client KP824$ npm test

> client@0.0.0 test
> jest

 FAIL  tests/__tests__/App.test.tsx
  ‚óè Test suite failed to run

### After restart of vs code:
-Error in App.test.tsx file:
```
Cannot find name 'test'. Do you need to install type definitions for a test runner? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/jest` or `npm i --save-dev @types/mocha`.ts(2582)
```

- Updated "jsx" configration to "react-jsxdev"
- Added "tests" to the "includes" config within the tsconfig.json property
- Added the following to the `jest.config.ts` file. This configuration is an array of regex that Jest will use to determine which files should not be transformed. The regex expression `\\.css$` targets CSS files specifically 
```
transformIgnorePatterns: [
    '/node_modules/',
    '\\.css$'
  ]
```
- [Thread that gave clue to include "tests" folder within tsconfig.config "include" config](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31226)
- [Also helpful thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63904196/esmoduleinterop-flag-set-still-getting-default-import-error)
  - `"include": ["src", "tests"],`

- Tried alternative : `npm install --save-dev identity-obj-proxy`

```
moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy'
  },
```
- Next, updated testEnvironment in jest.config.ts to `testEnvironment: 'jsdom',  // Set test environment to jsdom`
- Installed **jsdom**: `npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom`
  - [Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-environment-jsdom)
- Test FINALLY PASSING! SUCCESS!!!

### Need to do next: 
- Check if same amount of installing is required for back end testing in jest. 
- Currently only have client folder working properly


## Monday December 4th
- Created new branch for ticket #7. Will create a display that will render the data from the endpoints passed through.
- Created pages folder and moved App/HomePage to folder
- Updated `main.tsx` with createRoot + router configurations to route from home page to the test display component
- Created TestDisplay component & added styling for display structure
- Install axios: `npm install axios`
- Imported Plant list and Plant details into the test display component. 



## Tuesday December 5th
- Styled display components. Had issues with getting the DataContent components to fit within the DisplayPage container. The proper fix was using "max-height" on the DisplayContainer
- Imported fetch requests for the three available endpoints for free tier plant API
- Created mock data files to render for testing up coming results page
- The Plant List endpoint will return 1 page of up to 30 plants
- Will need to select since plant ID and then send a second request to get specific plant details

- Code block from Stephanie. Required inputs from user to properly write query to the API
- Reference later when creating questionnaire page
```
export function processParams(inputNumber: number, inputString: string) {
  const numToString: { [key: number]: string } = {
    1: "none",
    2: "minimum",
    3: "average",
    4: "frequent",
  };

  const wateringParam = numToString[inputNumber];

  let indoorParam;
  if (inputString === "indoor"  inputString === "Indoor") {
    indoorParam = 1;
  } else if (inputString === "outdoor"  inputString === "Outdoor") {
    indoorParam = 0;
  }
  return {
    wateringParam,
    indoorParam,
  };
}
```

## Wednesday Dec. 6th
- Uninstall `apollo-server-core` && `apollo-server-express` since both are **deprecated**
- Followed docs here to update index.ts file:
  - [Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration)
- Current error on `getTokenFromRequest` method:
  ```Cannot find name 'getTokenFromRequest'.ts(2304)
  any```


## Saturday December 16th

- Goal today is to complete configuration of jest for the server folder
- [Documentation for testing react components](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/)

- Here is a list of topics for us to test on the backend, using Jest:
  1. **Server-Side Logic:**
    - You can write unit tests for functions and modules that handle server-side logic.
    - Jest allows you to test various scenarios and edge cases to ensure your server-side code behaves as expected.
  
  2. **API Endpoints:**
    - If your backend exposes RESTful API endpoints, you can use Jest to write integration tests to verify the correctness of these endpoints.
    - Jest provides facilities for making HTTP requests and assertions, making it suitable for testing API responses.
  
  3. **GraphQL Resolvers:**
    - For a project involving GraphQL, you can use Jest to test your GraphQL resolvers.
    - Write tests to ensure that your resolvers handle queries and mutations correctly, and that they return the expected results.
  
  4. **Database Interactions:**
    - If your backend interacts with a database, you can use Jest to write tests that involve database operations.
    - Techniques like mocking or using a test database can help isolate your tests and avoid affecting the production database.

- Installing dependencies: `npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest`
- Updated scipt "test" to "jest" within package.json
- Created `jest.config.ts` file within the root of the `server` folder
- Within `tsconfig.json` file, added "jest" to the "types" property
- Created `__tests__` folder within the root of the `server` folder
  - Create `index.test.ts` file within `__tests__` folder
- Modified the `index.ts` file so that the functions `getTokenFromRequest` and `startApolloServer` are about to be exported to test. 
- Set up first test to test the `getTokenFromRequest` function. Test is successfully passing


## Thursday Jan 4th, 2024
- Goals today:
  - Create a modal for user auth components
  - Create login / register components
  - Implement successful toggeling of either components


- Created modal with test text box
  - Will need to add state management with redux to toggel 

- Created user Auth Slice and added to the redux store
- Creating container display for login component
- Installed "react-icons" for "x" for login component
- Creating Sign up component
  - Only implementing the "x" icon to be able to toggle open and closing the modals


## Monday Jan 8th, 2024
### General approach for setting up modal and toggling for login / signup components

1. Store file:
import modal, login & signup reducers
add modal, login & signup reducers

2. Features -> modal -> modal slice:
- Instantiate two reducers (openModal & closeModal)
- export for use
- cleaned up console logs

Features -> userAuth -> loginSlice:
- Instantiate initial state of login component & two reducers (openLogin & closeLogin)
- export for use

Features -> userAuth -> signUpSlice:
- Instantiate initial state of signup component and two reducers (openSignUp & closeSignUp)
- export for use

- Initial approach for implementing toggle for modal and login/singup component, within the modalSlice:
```
const modalSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'modal',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    openModal: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.isOpen = true;
      state.activeComponent = action.payload;
    },
    closeModal: (state) => {
      state.isOpen = false;
      state.activeComponent = null;
    },
  },
});
```
- This approach above did not work. With console logs, we could see that the clicking of the buttons on `login` or `signup` buttons on the `navbar` did correctly update the state for the modal. However, the console logs within the "Login" and "Signup" components themselves, showed that their state was set to undefined. The console logs from the parent component (navbar) was showing that the state was updated. The use of useEffects within each of the child components (login/signup) also showed that the state would render "underfined". 
- The current resolution was to instantiate slices for each of the components individually, and set their initial state to a boolean value. This worked much better than asking the parent component (Modal) to read their property of `activeComponent` and render the respective component.


3. components -> Modal.tsx:
	- Create Modal component
	- styled component to blur the background so user auth components can be focused
	- z-index is set to 5 (login & signup components set to z-index 10)
	- Modal component imports Login & SignUp components:
		- Modal conditionally renders either Login or SignUp component, based on which ever button was clicked on (Buttons are located on navbar component)

  - Initial approach for Modal creation:
```
//render with conditional:
{isOpen && (
  <ModalContainer>

    <button onClick={handleCloseModal}>
      &times;
    </button>

    <TestBox>
      <h3>Hello inside Modal</h3>
    </TestBox>
    
    {activeComponent === 'login' && <Login />}
    {activeComponent === 'signup' && <SignUp />}

  </ModalContainer>
)} 
```


4. Navbar component improvements:

- Initial approach for implementing the modal and the login/signup components:
```
const handleLoginClick = () => {
  console.log(`Inside handle login click`);
  const result = dispatch(openModal('login')); // Pass the component identifier
  console.log(`Dispatch result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
  dispatch(openModal());
};

const handleSignUpClick = () => {
  console.log(`Inside handle signup click`);
  const result = dispatch(openModal('signup')); // Pass the component identifier
  console.log(`Dispatch result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
  dispatch(openModal());
};

// log to check the current state from store
  const sliceCheck = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.modalToggle);
  console.log(`sliceCheck: ${JSON.stringify(sliceCheck)}`)

// useEffect logs to check current react state and if the components were rerendering correctly when state was being updated:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Effect LOGIN ran: State: ${JSON.stringify(selectModalState)}`);
}, [selectModalState]);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Effect SIGNUP ran: State: ${JSON.stringify(selectModalState)}`);
}, [selectModalState]);
```

- Import Modal component, openLogin & openSignUp slices
- In the component logic section, create functions that use the proper reducers to toggle the preferred component
- In return statement: Conditionally renders Modal component when either "Login" or "Signup" button is clicked. One of the two reducers attached to the both buttons, will set Modal.isOpen state to `true`

5. Build Login component within components folder:
	- import closeModal, closeLogin, and openSignUp slices
	- Within component logic:
		- Create place holder for Login submit button
		- Create helper functions to help toggling of login component or switching to SignUp component

6. Build SignUp component within components folder:
	- import closeModal, closeSignUp, and openLogin slices
	- Within component logic:
		- Create place holder for SignUp submit button
		- Create helper functions to help toggling of signup component or switching to Login component


7. Cleaned up unneccessary code / console logs on homepage page



## Tuesday Jan 16th
### Created Infinite slider component
- Created styled components for slider wrapper, container, images slider, and plant image components
- Created a variable to container the keyframes css styling attributes
  - Resources for keyframes:
    - [Freecodecamp Blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-css-in-5-minutes-e0804813fc3e/)
    - [Styled components animations](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#animations) 
    - [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes)

- To copy the images component, needed to use React's `useRef` hook to properly reference and clone
  - [Official docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)
-  Leveraged `useEffect` hook to automatically clone and append the image component on itself so that it will infinitely loop through its contents:
```
useEffect(() => {
    // Logic to clone and append the content after the component mounts
    if (imagesSliderRef.current) {
      // cloning logic targets the "ImageSlider" component directly. Clones the entire component then appends it to the parent node, which is the "ImageSlider"
      const copy = imagesSliderRef.current.cloneNode(true);
      imagesSliderRef.current.parentNode?.appendChild(copy);
    }
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this effect runs once after mount
```
- Images are currently hard coded in an array. Need to decide as a group if we'll keep this or implement a different approach

## Thursday Jan 18th
To do list:
- Create scroll triggered visibility effect for Nav component
- Update nav bar so that it is visible only after scrolling down at least 50vh
- Restructure hero section so that the home image is on the right side
  - Have text and call to action section on the left
- Entire hero section will be 100vh

### Making the Navbar only visible after scrolling down
- Create a boolean state within the redux store, initialize it to false
- Add it to the RootState and import the slice here so state is accessible to the component
- From the HomePage, pass the state prop down into the `Navbar` component `visible={isNavbarVisible}`
- Create interface for NavbarContainerProps within `types.ts` file
- Within the navbar component, we will initialize a useEffect where we can create a `handleScroll` function
  - This function's purpose will trigger the slice to update the `isNavbarVisible` state, depending on where the scrollY value is of the window
  - Will need to be able to track the Y coordinates based on user scrolling on the window
- Once the useEffect is properly setup, we will need to pass the property into the return statement where the `Navbar` component is being rendered 

## Monday Jan 22th
- Adjusted the useEffection and handleScroll function within the Navbar component.
- Updated the navbarSlice -> setNavbarVisibility reducer to assign the state of the isNavbarVisible to a boolean value:
```
const handleScroll = () => {
    const isVisible = window.scrollY > 100;
    dispatch(setNavbarVisibility(isVisible));
};
```
Explanation: Whenever the Y axis becomes larger than 100, then this statement will become true and assigned to the `isVisible` variable. This boolean value will be passed into the `setNavbarVisibility` reducer
- The navbar is currently only rendering after we scroll down on y axis, but styling for navbar component needs to be updated.
- Commented out login/signup buttons since userAuth feature has not been implemented yet
- Removed header component from Navbar, commented out Menu Icon (no functionality attached, not needed at the moment)
- Updated styling for Nav, Ul, Li components
- [Docs for working with opacity issue](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/1198)
- Result was creation of StyledNavbar component, separate from the conditionally rendered Nav component before. Creating a separate component allowed us to pass in properties to it without causing this styled-component error:
```
Warning: React does not recognize the `isNavbarVisible` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `isnavbarvisible` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
nav
O2@http:
```
- Opacity style attribute is not working as intended. Need to return to this issue later
- Adjusted navbar slice so that the `setNavbarVisibility` reducer would be able to accept and assign boolean values
[Docs for learning this here](https://redux.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript)


## Jan 23rd
- Removed unnecessary global styling within navbar component
- Synced styling with hero section
- Working on hero section
- Added routes to main.tsx so we can utilize Link component from react router
  - Update the anchor tags within the navbar to `link` components
  - Find out that `Link` with react-router-dom is not the smooth scrolling effect that we wanted
- Installing react-scroll for smooth scroll effect to sections `npm install react-scroll`
- Also requires types for typescript `npm install --save @types/react-scroll`
  - [npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-scroll)
  - [React-scroll docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)
  - `Import { Link, animateScroll as scroll from react-scroll` in Navbar component
  - Import then ecapsulate respective sections with the `Element` component on the `HomePage` file
  - Add "to", "spy", "smooth" and "duration" attributes to each `Link`
  
- Need to fix white border around HomePage

- Adding button to link to get started page in hero section  

## Jan 24th
- Merged with updated dev branch. Synced styling
- Updated routes and tabs for navbar

### Building Review Components
- [Review Section structure inspiration](https://dev.to/ryaddev/building-a-testimonials-carousel-with-react-nuka-carousel-and-tailwind-css-1e7)
- Building **Review Section**:
  - Assigned review container to be flex column
  - Review Title component and Review cards wrapper are two child elements to review container
  - Declared a reviews array to container user reviews in objects.
  - Inside CardWrapper component, map through reviews array and render a ReviewCard component, passing through five properties (key, userName, userImage, content, userTitle)
  - Navigate to `types.ts` file in root client folder, export and declare interface with property types assiginment for the **reviews** array in ReviewSection (typescript)
  - Import mock data images from assets
  - Fill out **reviews** array with mock data

### Building Review Card
- [Review card inspiration](https://github.com/cyrilcabo/material-testimonial-card)
- Building **ReviewCard**:
  ![Example Card](./examples/ReviewCard%20Example.jpg)
Card is layered into four main components:
  1. **GREEN** outline - Card component:
    - Main thing to focus on here to achieve current look is the `margin-top: 80px;` attribute. This pushes the top of the card downwards 80px
    - Added hover attribute that will transform and transition the card to create a pop-up effect
    - Will need to update media queries for more responsiveness
  2. **RED** outline - User Image component:
    - This component has a visual floating with the user's image. To achieve this, sync the user iamge component with the background color of its parent component
    - Create a specific component just for the user image and assign its height and width to be 90% (or whatever is desired) of the user image container. Make sure overflow is hidden
  3. **BLUE** outline - Content component:
    - This component has unique attributes. Within the component's styling, we are assigning specific content to be styled **BEFORE** and **AFTER** any *paragraph* tags
    - Within in **BEFORE** and **AFTER**, the content attribute is assinging opening and closing quotations using **UNICODE characters**
 ```
// code block within the styling of Content component:

 & > p {
    &:before {
      content: "\\201C"; // Unicode character for opening quotation mark
      font-size: 2rem;
      color: #f08080;
    }

    &:after {
      content: "\\201D"; // Unicode character for opening quotation mark
      color: #f08080;
      font-size: 2rem;
      position: absolute;
    }
 ```
  4. **PURPLE** outline - User Title component:
    - Basic flex container with margin-bottom to align it closer to the content component
    - Utilizing specific styling assignments to `h3` & `p` tags within the `UserTitle` styled-component declaration

- Navigate to `types.ts` in client root folder and declare interface for Review Card Props and assign types, similar to Reviews Content interface
- Import and assign `ReviewCardProps` typing to the `ReviewCard` component. Then pass in the destructured properties into the function
  
- Synced up Titles styling in all the other main sections


## Jan 27th
- Focus today is stylizing features component. Goal to make create a modal that will render on hover on each feature card
- First, need to modularize features component, by creating an individual "FeaturesCard" and then passing props to it from the parent component (FeaturesSection)
- Create `FeatureCard` component
- Create & style two main components `CardOverlay` & `CardContainer`
  - **`CardOverlay`**: (the modal component that is renderd on top of the card container)
    - Main CSS attributes to note here: 
      1. `top: 100%;` sets the starting position of the overlay component to the top of the card container
      2. `transform: translateY(-100%);` assigns the component to transform -100% off screen
      3. `transition: transform 1s;` the css smooth animate attribute and it's duration to completion
 
  - **`CardContainer`**: (the main card container "underneath" the overlay)
    - Main CSS attributes  to note here:
      1. `overflow: hidden;` Allows the `translateY(-100%)` to not be visible once it transitions on hover
      2. `position: relative;` Relative to the `absolute` position of the overlay
      3. `&:hover ${CardOverlay} {transform: translateY(0);}` initiates a hover effect, bringing the overlay down on the screen to a vertical position of 0
- Ended with a succesfully functioning modal effect


## Jan 28th
- Goal today to finish stylizing the features section and update content for features section
- Inside `FeaturesSection` declare an array of objects to contain feature cards content
- Navigate to `types.ts` file in root client folder, export and declare interface with property types assiginment for the **features** array in FeaturesSection (typescript)
- Back in `FeaturesSection` need to create a `CardWrapper` component to be able to center the `FeatureCard` components since the section is set up with with **grid**
  - [Centering grid items](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-center-the-content-in-grid.html)
- Map through the `features` array and pass through the properties from the `FeaturesContent` interface

### Passing props to styled components:
- Ran into an issue where there was conflict with using the general `FeatureCardProp` interface for the `CardOverlay` & `CardContainer` components.
  - The solution here required us to define specific interfaces for each component so that their interfaces did not overlap:
  ```
  interface CardOverlayProps {
    overlayImage: string;
  }

  interface CardContainerProps {
    cardImage: string;
  }
  ```
  - CSS attritbutes to note:
    1. `background: url(${(props) => props.overlayImage}) center/cover `
    2. `background: url(${(props) => props.cardImage}) center/cover `

    - This setup allowed us to accept the string values that are declared within the `features` array from the parent component
    - Just remember to also pass the props to the components within the return statement as well

- Lots of CSS styling adjustments
- Need to finalize FONTS
