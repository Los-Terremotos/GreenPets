# Concerning schema routing in the `codegen.ts` file in the `client` folder:

Transitioning your Apollo Client codegen setup from development to production smoothly involves managing the GraphQL schema reference effectively. Your current configuration points to a local development server. For production, you'll typically want to point to a production GraphQL endpoint. Here are some best practices to handle this:

### 1. Environment Variables
- Use environment variables to dynamically set the GraphQL endpoint. This allows you to have different endpoints for development, staging, and production environments.
- For instance, in your `codegen` configuration file, you can replace the hard-coded endpoint with an environment variable:
  ```javascript
  schema: process.env.GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT
  ```
- Set the `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` environment variable in your development and production environment files respectively.

### 2. Separate Configuration Files
- Maintain separate codegen configuration files for development and production environments.
- For example, you could have `codegen.dev.js` for development and `codegen.prod.js` for production, each pointing to the appropriate GraphQL endpoint.

### 3. Scripting in package.json
- Modify your `package.json` to use different scripts for development and production. For example:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "codegen:dev": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.dev.js",
    "codegen:prod": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.prod.js"
  }
  ```
- This approach allows you to run the appropriate script based on the environment.

### 4. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) Setup
- In your CI/CD pipeline, ensure that the correct environment variables or configuration files are used when building for production.
- Automate the code generation process in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that it always uses the latest schema from your production server.

### 5. Version Control Practices
- Do not commit environment-specific endpoints or secrets to your version control system. Use `.env` files or your CI/CD system's environment variable management features.

### 6. Schema Management
- In a production setup, consider having a schema registry or a similar setup where your schema can be versioned and managed. Tools like Apollo Studio can be used for this purpose.
- Regularly update your schema in the registry and ensure your codegen process uses this updated schema.

### Conclusion
These best practices allow you to separate concerns between development and production environments effectively. By relying on environment variables, separate configuration files, and appropriate scripting, you can ensure a smooth transition of your Apollo Client codegen setup from development to production. Remember to test your production build process thoroughly to avoid any surprises when deploying to production.
